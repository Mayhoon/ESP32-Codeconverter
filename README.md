# ESP32-Codeconverter
Converts your beautiful, perfectly written code into one ugly string so that your ESP32 can serve it.
The program takes the (html) file and adds a newline operator to the beginning of each line.

Run the jar within the directory that contains your "index.html" file.
- The generated output.txt file contains the string.
- The string is also copied directly into your clipboard so you can just paste it
